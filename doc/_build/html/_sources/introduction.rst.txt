Introduction
****************

:py:mod:`pyqha` is a Python package to perform quasi-harmonic and related calculations from total energies at 0 K, elastic constants at 0 K and phonon densities of states. The package provides Python functions to postprocess the results of your favourite DFT code, such as Quantum Espresso [#QE]_ or VASP [#VASP]_, to obtain quasi-harmonic properties. It is meant to be imported in your own code or used to produce quasi-harmonic results (see the Tutorial part of this documentation). It is also meant for people who want to tinker with the code and adapt it to their own needs. Finally note that you may couple the package with some other available calculation Python tools, such as `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/about.html>`_ or `AiiDA <http://www.aiida.net/>`_.
The package is based on numpy, scipy and matplotlib libraries.

A non-exhaustive list of properties which can be obtained using :py:mod:`pyqha` is:

* quasi-harmonic Helmholtz energy for isotropic and anisotropic unit cells
* quasi-harmonic thermal expansions for isotropic and anisotropic unit cells
* quasi-harmonic bulk modulus for isotropic unit cells
* quasi-harmonic heat capacity for isotropic unit cells
* quasi-static elastic constants for anisotropic unit cells

Current features of the package include: 

* Fit the total energy :math:`E_{tot}(V)` with Murnaghan's equation of state
* Fit the total energy :math:`E_{tot}(a,b,c)`, where :math:`(a,b,c)` are the lattice parameters of hexagonal, tetragonal, orthorombic cells, using a quadratic or quartic polynomial
* Minimize the energy :math:`E_{tot}(V)+F_{vib}(V,T)` as a function of temperature with Murnaghan's equation of state
* Minimize the energy :math:`E_{tot}(a,b,c)+F_{vib}(a,b,c,T)` as a function of temperature using a quadratic or quartic polynomial
* Calculate the quasi-static elastic constant tensor as a function of temperature

The equations to obtain these properties are relatively simple, for an introduction on the quasi-harmonic approximation you can see Baroni et al., available online at `<https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4977>`_ or [#Palumbo]_. For an introduction on quasi-static elastic constants see [#Wang]_ Have a look at the very good documentation of the *thermo_pw* fortran package available at `<http://qeforge.qe-forge.org/gf/project/thermo_pw/>`_.

================
Installation
================

You can download all package files from GitHub (https://github.com/mauropalumbo75/pyqha) and then install it with the command:

.. code-block:: bash 

   sudo python setup.py install


The most useful functions for the common user are directly accessible from the :py:mod:`pyqha`. You can import all of them as:

.. code-block:: python 

   from pyqha import *

or you can import only the ones you need. The above command also makes available a number of useful constants that you can use for unit conversions.

More functions are available as submodules. See the related documentation for more details. Note, however, that most of these functions are less well documented and are meant for advanced users or if you want to tinker with the code.

General notes
================

The parameter *ibrav*, which occurs in many functions of this package, identifies the Bravais lattice of the system as in Quantum Espresso. Currently, only cubic (*ibrav=1,2,3*), hexagonal (*ibrav=4*), tetragonal (*ibrav=6,7*), orthorombic (*ibrav=8,9,10,11*) lattices are implemented. Note that only the variation of phonon frequencies over a grid :math:`(a,b,c)` of lattice parameters can be carried out for now. Angles and internal degrees of freedom (atomic positions) cannot be considered. Thus, different *ibrav* can give the same grid:

    +-----------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
    | *ibrav*                     | Grid                             | Fitting polynomial               |
    +-----------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ 
    | 1,2,3                       | :math:`(a,a,a)`                  | 1 variable, 2nd or 4th degree    |
    +-----------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ 
    | 4,6,7                       | :math:`(a,a,c)`                  | 2 variables, 2nd or 4th degree   |
    +-----------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ 
    | 8,9,10,11                   | :math:`(a,b,c)`                  | 3 variables, 2nd or 4th degree   |
    +-----------------------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
