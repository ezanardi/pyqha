This is a first experimental release of a python code for quasi-harmonic calculations.
The code can calculate thermophysical properties such as thermal expansions, free energies, bulk modulus and more from phonon frequencies, density of states and total energies obtained using your favourite DFT code or similar. For example, several of the input quantities can be calculated using Quantum Espresso (http://www.quantum-espresso.org/) or Thermo_pw (http://qeforge.qe-forge.org/gf/project/thermo_pw/).
